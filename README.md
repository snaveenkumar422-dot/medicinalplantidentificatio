Medicinal Plant Identification Using Image Classification
Deep Learning | CNN | Python | TensorFlow/Keras

This project aims to identify medicinal plant species from images using deep learning-based image classification.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on a dataset of medicinal plant images to accurately predict the plant species and provide potential therapeutic benefits.

Features

Image classification using CNN / Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2/ResNet50)
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

OpenCV / Pillow

Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
Preprocessing and augmentation of plant images

Training, validation, and testing pipelines

High-accuracy prediction on unseen plant photos

Simple UI / script to upload an image and get prediction

Mapped therapeutic benefits for each plant species

🌱 How the Model Works

Images are loaded and preprocessed (resized, normalized).

Augmentation applied to avoid overfitting.

CNN/Transfer Learning model trained on labeled medicinal plant images.

After training, the model predicts the plant species from an uploaded photo.

Mapped therapeutic benefits are displayed after prediction.
